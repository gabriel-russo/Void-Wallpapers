## Workflow:

### Downloading images:
1. You can download manually or with download_images.sh script
2. Put all downloaded images in `assets/walls`
3. After that, execute the script `bg_resolution.sh` to organize by screen resolution (`assets/High Resolution/` or `assets/Low Resolution/`). **(require ImageMagick package to run)**

### Pull Request

 - No other distros allowed, just Void or Source Linux
